#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Consolas Nerd Font
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

font_size 10.0

# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

disable_ligatures always

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures.
#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features setting.


box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

#: }}}

#: Cursor customization {{{

cursor #cccccc

#: Default cursor color

cursor_text_color background

#: Choose the color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered
#: with the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background

cursor_shape underline

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)

cursor_beam_thickness 1.5
cursor_underline_thickness 1.0

cursor_blink_interval 0

#: The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero
#: to disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that numbers smaller than repaint_delay will be limited to
#: repaint_delay.

cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity.  Set to zero to never stop blinking.

#: }}}



#: Mouse {{{

mouse_hide_wait 0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text. Disabled by default on macOS as getting it to work
#: robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that is Cocoa is too
#: much effort.

#url_color #0087bd
#url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, single, double, curly

open_url_modifiers kitty_mod

#: The modifier keys to press when clicking with the mouse on URLs to
#: open the URL


#: }}}


#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell yes

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs.

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  no
initial_window_width  562
initial_window_height 338

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

#: }}}


#: Tab bar {{{

tab_bar_edge bottom

#: Which edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom

tab_bar_margin_width 2.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts)

tab_bar_style fade

#: The tab bar style, can be one of: fade, separator, powerline, or
#: hidden. In the fade style, each tab's edges fade into the
#: background color, in the separator style, tabs are separated by a
#: configurable separator, and the powerline shows the tabs as a
#: continuous line. If you use the hidden style, you might want to
#: create a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with
#: a list of tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown

tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

tab_separator " â”‡"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity.

tab_title_template "{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title. If you wish to include the tab-index as well, use something
#: like: {index}: {title}. Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for
#: goto_tab N. In addition you can use {layout_name} for the current
#: layout name and {num_windows} for the number of windows in the tab.
#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example: {fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.default}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}green
#: bg{fmt.bg.normal}. Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: {fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}.

active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs, if not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

#active_tab_foreground   #000
#active_tab_background   #eee
#active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
#inactive_tab_foreground #444
#inactive_tab_background #999
#inactive_tab_font_style normal

#: Tab bar colors and styles

#tab_bar_background none

#: Background color for the tab bar. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color.

#: }}}


#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: For a list of key names, see: the GLFW key macros
#: <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/blob/master/glfw/glfw3.h#L349>.
#: The name to use is the part after the GLFW_KEY_ prefix. For a list
#: of modifier names, see: GLFW mods
#: <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-keyboard option.
#: Then kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that
#: text look for ``native_code`` the value of that becomes the key

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: The value of kitty_mod is used as the modifier for all default
#: shortcuts, you can change it in your kitty.conf to change the
#: modifiers for all the default shortcuts.

clear_all_shortcuts no

#: You can have kitty remove all shortcut definition seen up to this
#: point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: You can create aliases for kitten names, this allows overriding the
#: defaults for kitten options and can also be used to shorten
#: repeated mappings of the same kitten with a specific group of
#: options. For example, the above alias changes the default value of
#: kitty +kitten hints --hints-offset to zero for all mappings,
#: including the builtin ones.

#: Clipboard {{{

map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard

#: There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#: mapped to Ctrl+c. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#: send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly, copy_and_clear_or_interrupt
#: will copy and clear the selection or send an interrupt if there is
#: no selection.

map kitty_mod+v  paste_from_clipboard
map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
map shift+insert paste_from_selection
map kitty_mod+o  no_op
map ctrl+c copy_and_clear_or_interrupt
map ctrl+v paste_from_clipboard

#: }}}

#: Tab management {{{

map kitty_mod+right next_tab
map kitty_mod+left  previous_tab
map kitty_mod+t     new_tab
map kitty_mod+q     close_tab
map kitty_mod+.     move_tab_forward
map kitty_mod+,     move_tab_backward
map kitty_mod+alt+t set_tab_title

#: You can also create shortcuts to go to specific tabs, with 1 being
#: the first tab, 2 the second tab and -1 being the previously active
#: tab, and any number larger than the last tab being the last tab::

#:     map ctrl+alt+1 goto_tab 1
#:     map ctrl+alt+2 goto_tab 2

#: Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of
#: arbitrary commands to run when using new_tab and use
#: new_tab_with_cwd. Finally, if you want the new tab to open next to
#: the current tab rather than at the end of the tabs list, use::

#:     map ctrl+t new_tab !neighbor [optional cmd to run]
#: }}}
